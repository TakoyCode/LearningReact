Example of how you can style using css modules

With css modules, you can avoid naming conflicts.
Cause each class that comes from it, 
gets a unique class name with a unique hash in the name.

modules also help if each component has their own unique styles.

The dowsides are that it does require extra setup and
global styles aren't applied as easily.
